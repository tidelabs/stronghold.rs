The Stronghold team endeavors to ship several production ready applications, which are more than classical "examples":

- [commandline](https://github.com/iotaledger/stronghold.rs/tree/dev/products/commandline): Interact with a stronghold snapshot from the commandline. Mostly for debugging and utility, not recommended for daily use

These products are documented in their respective code repositories.
